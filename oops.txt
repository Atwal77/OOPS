->virtual functions(function overriding,early binding,late binding);

->inheritance

->access specifier :-> learn which one can use the data members present in public,protected and private:-> for eg:->
protected characteristics will be used by derived class ,its own class and friend function;
private characteristics will be used by its own class and friend function;

->abstract class (using pure virtual function in c++)

->this pointer (when member function is called by the object then "this" pointer is also created in that function memory which refers to the caller object)


->Static memory allocation vs Dynamic memory allocation (new and delete)
	
	->static (memory created by sma has a certain scope->"{}" but dma dont)
	->we had to delete the dma memory manually using delete keyword;
	->the memory that had to be created for sma variable is decided at compile time but for dma it is decided at run time;


-> method overriding,method hiding, method overloading

->Polymorphism implemented by:->
